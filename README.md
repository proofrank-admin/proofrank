**Date Anchored:** 2025-06-13 15:25 UTC

## What is ProofRank?
ProofRank is a global trust protocol that verifies real work across borders, tools, and timelines.  
It supports:

- Moonlighters
- Layoff victims
- AI-assisted contributors
- Invisible internal performers
- Visa-grade work proof

## Why it matters
In a world full of clones and anonymous digital work, ProofRank creates a timestamped, peer-verifiable trail of contribution â€” without needing trust in a single employer or platform.

## Scenario Canon
- Scenario #001: Manager credit theft
- Scenario #002: Layoff with no proof
- Scenario #003: Moonlighting under NDA
- Scenario #004: Proxy worker with real work
- Scenario #005: AI-assisted contributor
- Scenario #006: Fresh grad with real internship
- Scenario #007: Peer collusion attempt
- Scenario #008: Public repo fork with improvements
- Scenario #009: Post-facto claim from fired dev
- Scenario #010: Underpaid worker without public logs
- Scenario #011: Internal quiet performer with no drama
